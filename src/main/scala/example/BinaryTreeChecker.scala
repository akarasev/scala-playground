  * <h3>Trees: Is This a Binary Search Tree?</h3>
  * <p>
  *   A binary search tree to be a binary tree with the following ordering
  *   properties:
  * </p>
  * <ul>
  *   <li>
  *     The data value of every node in a node's left subtree is less than
  *     the data value of that node.
  *   </li>
  *   <li>
  *     The data value of every node in a node's right subtree is greater
  *     than the data value of that node.
  *   </li>
  * </ul>
  * <p>
  *   Given the root node of a binary tree,
  *   it is needed to determine if it's also a binary search tree
  * </p>
